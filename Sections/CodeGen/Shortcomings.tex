\subsection{Known shortcomings in CodeGen}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scan does not currently work, but has been worked on.
	\item Replicate does currently not work on bools since \textit{true} and \textit{false} has not yet been implemented. Only ints has been tested, but it is currently assumed replicate works for ints and chars (given these are the types implemented in the type checker) (should replicate work for advanced data structures like arrays?) 
\end{enumerate}
